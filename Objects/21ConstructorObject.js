/*
The Object Constructor
We mentioned the term constructor back in section one, when we talked about making an object using the keyword new. A constructor is a way to
* create an object.

When we write bob = new Object( ); we are using a built-in constructor called Object. This constructor is already defined by the JavaScript 
* language and just makes an object with no properties or methods.

This means we have to add our properties one at a time, just like we've been doing. To review, we've created bob using the constructor and 
* defined the name property for you.

Instructions
Finish making bob by defining the age property and setting it equal to 20
